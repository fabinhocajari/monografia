        <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
            <p>
                Practical Botany classes are essential in high school, as they allow students to understand the relationship between theoretical concepts and the reality of the biological world. Therefore, this study aimed to survey the use of practical Botany classes, improving improvements in the educational process of high school. Specifically, I intend to investigate the main methodologies used in practical Botany classes and how they are highlighted for student learning; evaluate the impact of practical classes on the development of students' cognitive skills and analyze the challenges faced by teachers when implementing practical Botany classes and possible solutions to overcome them. The course of the investigation revealed the most favorable opportunity for progress, making use of a qualitative and explanatory research. Qualitative, as it explores the subjective aspects inherent to specificities and social behaviors, and explanatory, as it reports in detail the observed elements and traits, exposing and allowing the interpretation of the information contained in the consulted theoretical references. Direct contact with the object gave a result considered overwhelming, which became possible through a study that showed that practical Botany classes bring improvements to the teaching and learning process for students, since they have direct contact with the objects. living beings and this action allows a diversified look that, in addition to being scientific, contributes to the preservation of the environment. The results found point to a more efficient and motivated learning through practical classes with a view to improving the performance of the educational process, but there is still some difficulty on the part of teachers in carrying out these classes that focus on the lack of materials, lack of laboratories , fragile-looking teacher training, among other demands that become arduous and hinder the process.
